# Binary Search Trees in JS

[Live](https://vorpus.github.io/TreeJS) | [Run Tests](https://vorpus.github.io/TreeJS/SpecRunner.html)

A JavaScript implementation of two Binary Search Tree data structures.
1. Binary Search Tree
2. Red-Black Tree

## Usage
Click on the [Live](https://vorpus.github.io/TreeJS) link above and use the graphical interface to see the trees in action.

## Commands

The following commands are available to construct BST's. The **Red-Black Tree** extends the BST so all of the above functions are also available.

`add` - Add a value or `TreeNode` object to the BST

`clear` - Resets root to null

`print` - Depth-first prints the tree

`find` - Locate a value (if the value is not found, locates the closest node)

`deleteVal` - Locate a node with given value and deletes it if found

`min` - Traverses tree for node with minimum value
