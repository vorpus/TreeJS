# Binary Search Trees in JS

Navigate to index.html and open up the console! A dummy tree can be accessed with the window variable `tree`.

## Commands
`add` - Add a value or `TreeNode` object to the BST

`print` - Depth-first prints the tree

`find` - Locate a value (if the value is not found, locates the closest node)
